Trains
======

We started with nothing, and made trains ride around a track without crashing.

This is the repository for our CS 452 (Realtime Operating Systems) project at the University of Waterloo. It covers the creation of a microkernel and a set of user tasks to controller trains using a microntroller.

If you are interested in how it works, feel free to peruse the `docs/` folder which contains all our design documents for each stage of the project in TeX format. Reading them will provide you an understanding of how each component of the system operated.

This project was a collaboration between:

  * Alexandru Ianus ([@aianus](http://www.github.com/aianus))
  * Avi Itskovich ([@aitskovi](http://www.github.com/aitskovi))
